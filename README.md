python3 manage.py populate_player_stats --seasons 2025

# This command will:
# - Fetch latest player stats from nflreadpy
# - Include Next Gen Stats (passing, receiving, rushing intelligence)
# - Update PlayerStats table with new data
# - Handle player name mapping automatically
```

### **Step 2: Update Team Defense Stats (Run Every Tuesday)**
```bash
# Update team defensive rankings and stats
python3 manage.py populate_team_defense --seasons 2025

# This command will:
# - Fetch latest team defensive stats
# - Calculate defensive rankings (passing, rushing, receiving)
# - Update TeamDefense table for opponent analysis
```

### **Step 3: Update Team Offense Stats (Run Every Tuesday)**
```bash
# Update team offensive rankings and stats
python3 manage.py populate_team_offense --seasons 2025

# This command will:
# - Fetch latest team offensive stats
# - Calculate offensive rankings and EPA
# - Update TeamOffense table for team strength analysis
```

### **Step 4: Refresh Prop Lines (Run Every Wednesday)**
```bash
# Get latest prop lines from PrizePicks API
python3 manage.py refresh_player_props

# This command will:
# - Fetch current week's prop lines
# - Update PlayerProp table with new odds
# - Handle new players and markets automatically
```

### **Step 5: Generate Predictions (Run Every Wednesday)**
```bash
# Generate ML predictions for all active props
python3 manage.py generate_predictions

# This command will:
# - Train models on latest 2025 data
# - Use all 75 features including Next Gen Stats
# - Generate over/under probabilities
# - Create Prediction records for web interface
```

recent = Prediction.objects.order_by('-created_at')[:5]
for p in recent:
    print(f'{p.player} - {p.prop_type}: {p.over_probability:.1f}% | {p.under_probability:.1f}%')
"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance Commands

### **Fix Player Mappings**
```bash
# Fix player name inconsistencies between nflreadpy and PrizePicks
python3 manage.py fix_all_player_mappings

# Fix specific player team assignments
python3 manage.py fix_all_player_teams

# Add missing players manually
python3 manage.py add_missing_players
```

### **Data Quality Checks**
```bash
# Check for players with missing team assignments
python3 manage.py shell -c "
from core.models import Player
unknown = Player.objects.filter(team__team_abbr='Unknown')
print(f'Players with unknown teams: {unknown.count()}')
for p in unknown[:10]:
    print(f'  {p.player_name} - {p.position}')
"

# Check prediction quality
python3 manage.py shell -c "
from core.models import Prediction
total = Prediction.objects.count()
high_conf = Prediction.objects.filter(over_probability__gt=70).count()
print(f'Total predictions: {total}')
print(f'High confidence over (>70%): {high_conf}')
"
```

### **Database Management**
```bash
# Run migrations if needed
python3 manage.py migrate

# Create superuser (first time only)
python3 manage.py createsuperuser

# Start development server
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## üìà Understanding Predictions

### **Probability Interpretation**
- **>70% Over**: Strong confidence in over hitting
- **60-70% Over**: Good confidence in over
- **50-60% Over**: Slight lean to over
- **40-50% Under**: Slight lean to under
- **30-40% Under**: Good confidence in under
- **<30% Under**: Strong confidence in under hitting

### **Edge Calculation**
- **Positive Edge**: Model predicts higher than line (favor over)
- **Negative Edge**: Model predicts lower than line (favor under)
- **Edge > 5**: Strong value play
- **Edge > 2**: Good value play

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **"No 2025 PlayerStats found"**
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py populate_player_stats --seasons 2025
   ```

2. **"Player not found" errors**
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py fix_all_player_mappings
   ```

3. **"Game not found" errors**
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py populate_games --seasons 2025
   ```

4. **Low prediction quality**
   ```bash
   # Check if Next Gen Stats are populated
   python3 manage.py shell -c "
   from core.models import PlayerStats
   ngs = PlayerStats.objects.filter(season=2025, avg_time_to_throw__isnull=False).count()
   print(f'Records with Next Gen Stats: {ngs}')
   "
   ```

### **Data Validation**
```bash
# Check all data sources
python3 manage.py shell -c "
from core.models import *
print('=== DATA SUMMARY ===')
print(f'Players: {Player.objects.count()}')
print(f'Teams: {Team.objects.count()}')
print(f'Games: {Game.objects.count()}')
print(f'PlayerStats (2025): {PlayerStats.objects.filter(season=2025).count()}')
print(f'TeamDefense (2025): {TeamDefense.objects.filter(season=2025).count()}')
print(f'TeamOffense (2025): {TeamOffense.objects.filter(season=2025).count()}')
print(f'PlayerProps: {PlayerProp.objects.filter(is_active=True).count()}')
print(f'Predictions: {Prediction.objects.count()}')
"
```

## üìù Notes
